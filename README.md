# Linux Browser Ansible Role

This role will install some Browsers for the Linux desktop.
It will also link some desktop menu entries from my [dotfiles](https://github.com/BennyLi/dotfiles).
For these to work my helper scripts (also located in my dotfiles) are linked. You can find the scripts here:

* [chromium-app-mode.sh](https://github.com/BennyLi/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/chromium-app-mode.sh)
* [firefox-dev-kiosk.sh](https://github.com/BennyLi/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/firefox-dev-kiosk.sh)
